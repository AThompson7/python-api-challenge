For the model showing Souther Hemisphere max temperatures vs latitude. We see a strong correlation coefficient of 0.83
indicating that as we move towards the equator, max temperatures will increase.

For the model showing Northern Hemisphere max temp and latitude. We can observe a negative
correlation coeffient of -0.66 as latitude increases from 0. This indicates decreasing max temperatures as we move away from the
equator which is consistent with our understanding of higher temperatures in closer vicinity to the equator.

For the city latitude and max temperature scatterplot. We can see as we approach 0 latitude max temperature increases then decreases again as we move away. This is becuase temperatures increase as we move closer to the equator then decrease as we move away.
